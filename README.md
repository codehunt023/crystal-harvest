# Crystal Harvest

## About

Crystal Harvest is a base-building strategy game made in Unity (version 2017.3.0f3). 

Your objective is to build a base on a desert planet and assist your astronauts in stealing space crystals. The conditions are harsh and the time is limited â€“ your astronauts must make it before their presence is detected by the planet's owners.

It's available in Polish and English versions. It can be played in the browser or downloaded here: [itch.io](https://janorzechowski.itch.io/crystal-harvest)
